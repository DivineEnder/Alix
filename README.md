# Win-Unix-Shell-WUS-
Win-Unix-Shell (WUS) is a project which uses a combination of batch and python scripting in order to bring some of the functionality afforded in to a Unix terminal to the windows command line while also adding several very helpful commands.

**It does not replace command line built in commands**

Instead WUS is an attempt to simulate some of the basic Unix commands using windows command line functionality. WUS not only tries to add command not previously found (such as the alias command), but also allows the use of the more command linux commands that already have Windows counterparts. This gives the user the ability to memorize the syntax realted to only one terminal, instead of constantly having to look up the comparable command in windows.
