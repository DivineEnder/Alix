# Alix
Alix is a project to replicate several of the more helpful commands from Unix that seem to be missing from Windows. It uses a combination of python scripting and batch files in order to create a better command line experience. Currently Alix needs to be cloned and then its root directory needs to bee added to the environment variables.
*To use Alix simply clone the repository and then add the repository directory to your environmental path variable.*

Alix also includes several over simple Unix commands that still have not been ported to Windows. See a full list of implementations in the wiki.
